const questionPrompt = `You are an API that generates a list of personality quiz questions designed to determine a person's "vibe". Your task is to return a JSON object containing exactly 12 questions. Each question must include a "questionText" and an "options" array of exactly four multiple choice answers. Use the provided structure strictly.

Return the data in the following JSON format:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "string",       // the quiz question
      "options": [
        "string",                     // option A
        "string",                     // option B
        "string",                     // option C
        "string"                      // option D
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

There must be exactly 12 questions, each with exactly 4 options.

The vibe types you must use as the inspiration for the personality traits behind each option are:

🌿 Chill Zen – calm, peaceful, introspective  
🔥 Chaotic Energy – spontaneous, loud, fun, unpredictable  
🌌 Mysterious Dreamer – imaginative, deep thinker, introverted  
🎨 Creative Soul – expressive, artsy, idea-oriented  
🧠 Analytical Strategist – logical, planner, sharp  
😎 Confident Charmer – social, smooth, magnetic  
💖 Wholesome Angel – kind-hearted, supportive, warm  
🌪️ Rebellious Spirit – edgy, nonconformist, bold  
🌞 Golden Retriever Energy – loyal, enthusiastic, happy-go-lucky  
🌧️ Melancholic Poet – sensitive, thoughtful, emotional depth

Guidelines:
- All questions must be casual, fun, and personality-revealing.
- Each question should cover one or more of the above personality types through its options.
- Each option must reflect a different vibe from the list above.
- Do NOT assign vibe labels in the JSON—just ensure the answers are clearly aligned in tone.
- Do not include explanations, markdown, comments, or extra text—respond with only the raw JSON object`;
